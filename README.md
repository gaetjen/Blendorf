Blendorf: A 3D visualisation tool for Dwarf Fortress using Blender

Blendorf aims to be a highly customisable 3D visualiser for exported Dwarf Fortress maps.

What sets it apart from other visualisers is:
	- easy customisability of the art assets
	- easily edit the generated map
	- make raytraced renders of your fortress
	- terrain that makes sense in the context of the game
	
It is supposed to enable the user to explore and show off his/her fortress and create art based on the game.
